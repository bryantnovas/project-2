# Forum Web App#

this as very simple forum web application designed to allow users to create topics and comment on those topics using markdown.

for this project I used the following APIs :

1. ipinfo, which allows the app to determine the location of a user that is either creating a topic or writting a comment for a specific topic.

1. redcarpet, takes a string and renders it into markdown. I used it to display the user comments to in a very organize and styled way.

Here is how the app basically works:
